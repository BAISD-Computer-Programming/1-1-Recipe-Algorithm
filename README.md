# Assignment 1: Recipe Algorithm

**Objective:**  
Work in a team to create a step-by-step algorithm for making **either** a Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich **or** a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  
Your goal is to write instructions so precise that a computer (or your teacher) could follow them exactly without guessing.

## 📋 Instructions

1. **Form Teams**  
   Work in teams of 2–4 students.

2. **Choose Your Recipe**  
   Pick **one** of the following:
   - Peanut butter and jelly sandwich
   - Grilled cheese sandwich

3. **Write Your Algorithm**  
   - Use **numbered steps**.
   - Be extremely specific. (e.g., “Pick up the knife by the handle” instead of “Grab the knife.”)
   - Assume your reader has **no prior knowledge**.

4. **Test Your Algorithm**  
   - Swap algorithms with another team.  
   - The other team will “execute” it **exactly as written** to see if it works.

5. **Refine & Submit**  
   - Make improvements based on testing.  
   - Submit your final algorithm as a **Markdown file** on GitHub Classroom.
